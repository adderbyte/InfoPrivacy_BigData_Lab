# Trace 3: Traceroute
## Briefly describe how the traceroute tool works including which network protocols are in use.

[When a TCP packet is sent, its Time To Live (TTL) is set - this corresponds to the number of routers or hops it can pass through before the packet is discarded. As the packet passes through a router the TTL is decremented. If a router receives a packet with TTl of 1 (it decrements it to zero --which means no more further traveling, and no forwarding ),  the packet is discarded. The information sent by the router receiving a packet with TTL of 1 back to the original sender is called as "ICMP TTL exceeded messages". Thus  the receiver will automatically come to know the address of the sender. 

Trace Route works by setting the TTL for a packet to 1, sending it towards the requested destination host, and listening for the reply. When the initiating machine receives a "time exceeded" response, it examines the packet to determine where the packet came from - this identifies the machine one hop away. Then the tracing machine generates a new packet with TTL 2, and uses the response to determine the machine 2 hops away, and so on. 
protocol used: ICMP (plus UDP on Linux Machine) ]

## Give the source IP address that issued the traceroute command and the destination IP address.

Source IP: [192.168.0.100]
Destination IP: [74.125.225.46]

## List the IP addresses on the route between source and destination (meaning:
do not include the IP addresses of the source and destination).
